| 1 | Next.js 16 middleware deprecation warning | `src/middleware.ts` | S24 | "middleware" convention deprecated in favor of "proxy". Works fine, migrate when convenient. |
| 2 | x402 paid route is non-streaming | `src/app/api/chat/paid/route.ts` | S24 | `withX402` expects `NextResponse<T>`, so paid route uses `messages.create` not `messages.stream`. Consider streaming upgrade later. |
